# ItaliaNissima
## A website for a food box subcription service!

This project was developed for a mandatory assignment of the **Codo a Codo 4.0** *Full Stack Development with Node.js* course.

We were provided with a basic template of a website, and we were tasked to edit it to fit our needs. It was mainly aimed to test our ability to adapt and add functionality to a code that had been developed collaboratively.

You can preview the website [here](https://catherinesofio.github.io/ItaliaNissima/)!
